# 60–90s Pitch Script

1) Problem: Stacks DeFi has great options, but newcomers don’t know where to start.
2) Solution: Connect wallet → AI analyzes balances and live protocol data → gives top 3 actions with APY, risk, and 1-click links.
3) Demo: I connect, set goal to "maximize yield", and see ALEX pools with estimated APY, risk notes, and a score. I click through.
4) How it works: Hiro API for balances, ALEX API for pools, scoring that blends yield and risk, transparent rationale.
5) Why it matters: More users can deploy BTC/STX productively—aligns with unlocking the Bitcoin economy.
6) What’s next: Add more protocols, deeper risk modeling, and position-aware suggestions.
