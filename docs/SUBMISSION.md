## Judging Criteria Mapping
- Technical quality: live data ingestion (ALEX/Hiro), UI, scoring, explainability
- Security: read-only integrations; user approvals; clear risk notes
- Ease of use: connect → set goal → top 3 options with APY, risk, link
- Bitcoin alignment: increases DeFi participation on Stacks, unlocking BTC utility

## Future Work
- More protocols, position-aware suggestions, testnet simulation, deeper risk modeling
